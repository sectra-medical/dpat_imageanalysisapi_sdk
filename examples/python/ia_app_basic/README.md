# pcaddemo

## About
This is a demo repository for a simple Sectra Image Analysis API (IA-API) implementation.

Author: Martin Lindvall, martin.lindvall@sectra.com

## Application function

- Input: User draws a polygon around a region of interest ( taggedPolygon, see `webserver.py:app_return_registerinfo` )
- Output: a graphical primitive, or a "patch gallery" (see `webserver.py:DEMO_TYPE` and `webserver.py:app_on_userinput` )

## Development notes
Uses a simple flask server for responding to IA-API requests and a requests-based client for outgoing communications with the IA-API..

For simplicity, uses no async libraries. For load-scaling, simply run with number of workers processes corresponding to expected max number of simultaneous users. Tools such as gunicorn or a similar pre-forking worker server is recommended to spawn the workers.

Should have no trouble scaling as long as number of max simultaneous users are below 1000 or so.

### Prerequisites

You currently need libgeos to build shapely. On ubuntu `sudo apt install libgeos-dev`.
The shapely dependency will eventually be removed.

### Install and run

You can run this example in a virtualenv using poetry, or directly in the current python environment.

Using poetry:
```
poetry install
poetry run python pcaddemo/__main__.py
```

As plain-old python:

```
pip install -e .
python pcaddemo/__main__.py
```

## Sectra Server configuration

Running this demo starts a web server on 0.0.0.0 (all local ips) listening on port 5001.

You need to configure the Sectra Pathology Server (SPS) to call this server. This involves:

1. Ensuring that the SPS can reach this host over the network (ensure there is a route and that firewall rules allow it)
2. Registering the IA-API app in the configuration interface (see chapter 7 in the System Administrator Manual)
  - in brief: goto https://<pathologyserver>/sectrapathologyimport/config
  - log in, click Image Analysis Applications
  - Under Server Side Applications, click 'register new'
  - Enter the URL where your started web server (this repository) is running, as reachable from the pathology server. Example: `http://my-ia-app-server:5001/iademo`
  - Press 'Retrieve registration Info'
  - The fields should be populated, press *Save*
  - Per default, the app is disabled. Click the 'disabled' button to toggle it to enabled.

If succesful, you should now be able to right-click in any Pathology Image and select your new IA-APP (you might need to refresh any running sessions).
